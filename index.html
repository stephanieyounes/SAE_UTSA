		<h4> We are Road Runner Racing, the Society of Automotive Engineers student chapter at UTSA. Each year, we design, manufacture, and compete race cars in the annual SAE International competition. Our organization is open to any UTSA students of any major or knowledge level.

SAE International hosts an engineering design competition annually all around the world. Our primary purpose is to design and manufacture performance racing machines for use in this competition using sound engineering practices. Members apply technical, business and innovative skills in order to accomplish our goal. 

We have general meetings every week in the Engineering Machine Shop on the main campus. AKA, the Power and Dynamic Systems Lab (PDSL) on the campus map. It is on far west campus near Tobin Laboratories, right next to the River Science Lab. 

Weeks between general meetings we host sub system meetings for our various sub systems. If you would like to know more find us on social media or email the UTSA Formula Gmail account to get on our mailing list. </h4>
